# rl_experiments

A set of scripts with tools and functions for benchmarking and analysis of generative reinforcement learning models.

Overview:
- analysis_utils.py: module containing tools for analysis.
- analysis_utils1.py: newer module containing updated tools for analysis. This module should be used in the future.
- egfr_demo.py: training routine for reinforcement learning to generate molecules with predicted activity against EGFR.
- gridsearch.py: script to run hyperparameter gridsearches for RL training routines.
